# Nest-Seq-Analysis

Songbirds (e.g., zebra finches) communicate with each other using precisely controlled sequences of learned vocal gestures. Like  speech  and  language,  birdsong  consists of discrete acoustic elements (syllables).

While birdsong learning is generally quite accurate, juveniles  (pupils)  have  been  found  to  modify drop, or rearrange syllables that are produced by their adult tutor. Quantifying the fidelity of and deviations in vocal learning is important for understanding learning process. 

Here we train two different types of LSTM (Unidirectional/Bidirectional) models on some tutor sequences from 10 dfferent Nests and try to see its performance on the pupil sequences. 

Contributions :

• Utilized features extracted from spectrograms of bird-song syllables using a pre-trained convolutional neural network

• Demonstrated utility of syllable sequence informati onto song classification
